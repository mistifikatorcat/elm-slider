I chose to build a slider because I thought it would be a good challenge, but it turned out to be a bit more complicated than I initially expected. The project required significant effort in studying, understanding, and diving deep into Elm components and figuring out how they integrate into the broader web application. My main goal was to get as close as possible to the original Bellroy slider and at the same time create something rugged, efficient, and easy to use without making things overly complicated.

I structured the component into clear, modular parts like the slider wrapper, track, and navigation controls. Responsiveness was ensured through a flexible grid layout, dynamic sizing, and media queries, making sure it looks and functions smoothly on any device or screen size.

When writing the CSS, I focused on maintainability and scalability by clearly dividing styles into distinct components, and using descriptive class names. Efficient data handling was important, so I implemented external data fetching to easily manage updates without having to modify the componentâ€™s internal structure.

Overall, the finished slider component is clean, robust, and similar to the original.
